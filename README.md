## Installation
1. Install **vagrant** and **virtualbox** (Windows user should prefer the Linux shell)
2. Go into the root directory and type **vagrant up**

## Nett To Know
- Use **vagrant destroy -f** to destroy the vm
- Using **vagrant halt** does not require a full reinstallation after a **vagrant up**
